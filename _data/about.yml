title: "A Little Bit About Myself"
description: |
  My name is Alfred. I finished my bachelors in Computer Science at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin in June 2025 and am now looking to do my masters in Human Computer Interaction. Outside of studying I do a lot of sports. I sailed in our local club for a long time and my sailing partner and I ran the youth training for several years. I'm also involved in a local music project for democracy and tolerance.
